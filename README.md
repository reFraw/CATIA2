### Description
This tool allows you to use convolutional neural networks for image analysis in a guided way and therefore suitable for beginners (like me).
Actually this project was born as a training tool for my programming skills.

### Dataset structure
To add a personal dataset, remember that it must have two folders, called 'training' and 'test', where in each one there are subfolders related to the classes.

### Usage
1) Wizard mode >>> Enter 'python main.py'

The initial start of the program allows the creation of the DATASETS, models_saved and results folders.

### Notes
1) The inspiration for the writing of this project comes from the TAMI tool (https://github.com/Djack1010/tami) used during my internship and thesis work.
2) Currently start the program using WSL.
