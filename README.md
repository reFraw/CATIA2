# CATIA2
 CNNs Aggregator Tool for Image Analysis 2
 
### Description
This tool allows you to use convolutional neural networks for image analysis in a guided way and therefore suitable for beginners (like me).
Actually this project was born as a training tool for my programming skills.

### Dataset structure
If you want to add a personal dataset, remember that it must have two folders, called 'training' and 'test', where in each one there are subfolders related to the classes.
See sample datasets in the 'DATASETS' folder.

### Notes
1) The inspiration for the writing of this project comes from the TAMI tool (https://github.com/Djack1010/tami) used during my internship and thesis work.

2) The SAMPLE model in 'models_saved' folder was trained on the AD000 dataset.
